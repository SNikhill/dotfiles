# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles that I tend to use on my system.
For now, I have just added a basic NeoVim's config (aka init.vim).

I shall update this repository with my i3 and xmonad config.

> **Note:**
> I am just a learner here. The config won't exactly be correct.
> I shall update the same as I progress along my learning journey.
